# TryHackMe: Pyramid Of Pain - Hashing Values, Malicious Files, IP Address Analysis 
1. Worked on Identifing Hash Values and using basic Command Line Commands were able to identify the hash of malicious files via different algorithims (Ex. MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, etc.)

2. Worked in a sandbox VM to identify malicious files and their source IPs. Was in a situation playing as a Security Analyst checking on a ransomeware-infected computer of an end-user.

3. Finished up with doing research using Open-Source tools (such as MetaDefender's OPSWAT) to analyze hashes and to identify the type of attack being conducted using that file's hash.
